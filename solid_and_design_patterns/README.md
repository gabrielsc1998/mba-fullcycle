## MBA Full Cycle - Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

- Base: https://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html
- There are many patterns that can be used to solve problems in software development;

- Layering:
    - Separation of responsibilities;
    - Abstration;
        - how much more abstract, more complex, but more flexible (in general);
        - how much coupling, more complex and less flexible;
    - Layer vs Tier:
        - Layer:
            - Logical separation;
            - Ex: Presentation, Business, Data;
        - Tier:
            - Physical separation;
            - Ex: Web, Application, Database;
    - 3 layers architecture:
        - Layers:
            - Presentation:
                - User interface;
                    - Ex: Web, Mobile, Desktop;
                - Formats:
                    - Ex: HTML, JSON, XML;
            - Domain:
                - Business rules;
                    - Ex: Business rules, Business services;
            - Data:
                - Data persistence;
                    - Ex: Database, File, Cache;
                - Message:
                    - Ex: Kafka, RabbitMQ;
        - Flux: Presentation -> Domain -> Data -> Domain -> Presentation;
            - Domain and data should never depend on presentation;
            - If domain depends on presentation, it will generate instability in the core of the system;
